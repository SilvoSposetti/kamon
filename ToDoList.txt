Loop between scenes when they finish?
shortcuts to Leo for German and some other website for English translations
fix bug of click functionality on suggestions (not only select with arrows)
check isRunning for every scene, so that onDestroy it will stop. Then remove console.log('finished')
make weather and location information fade in only when they are available
improve scene list: make its size variable + maybe one small image per scene
fix bug: when list with scenes is initialized, then should also have which of the scenes is highlighted.
