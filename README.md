# Kamon

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.4.3.

### Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.


# Build local version
To build a version which runs with the 'file:////' protocol then you need to build with the base -href flag set to './'

> ng build --base-href ./

Then you can place the content of the dist folder in any folder on your pc, open index.html with your browser and set the page as your homepage.


# Kamon

This is a browser starting page made with Angular 2+. It's main purpose is to replace browser bookmarks by combining keyboard shortcuts and google search into one app.
It's second purpose is to look cool, and thus it contains some background 'scenes' that use the HTML5 canvas in order to generate various animation.
This is a side project that I am doing just for fun, mostly because I like algorithms that generate cool animations.
